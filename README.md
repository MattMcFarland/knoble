### A self-hosted and open source collaboration tool for project management.

Knoble is inspired by the [Kanban board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board "Kanban board"), which you can find in use today within software suites such as JIRA, or TRELLO.

All of Knoble development has been recorded live on http://livecoding.tv/mmcfarland so that you can witness the process of creating a web application from scratch using node.js on the backend and html5/javascript on the front end.  We will be leveraging functional programming, unidirectional data flows, HTML, our own custom css, and websockets.

Specifically, this project is designed using [choo](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/choo "choo"), which is a fun functional framework for front end applications using unidirectional data flows like react/redux.

### Quick start

```
git clone https://github.com/MattMcFarland/knoble.git
